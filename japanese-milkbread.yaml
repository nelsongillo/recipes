instructions:
  tangzhong:
    - In a small saucepan, whisk together the flour, milk, and water until smooth.
    - Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens to a pudding-like consistency.
    - Remove from heat and let it cool to room temperature.

  dough:
    - In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, brown sugar, salt, and instant yeast.
    - Add the cooled tangzhong, warm milk and melted butter to the dry ingredients. Slightly mix until a a shaggy dough forms. Let it rest for 10 minutes.
    - Knead the dough for about 10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic, passing the windowpane test.
    - Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover and let it rise in a warm place until doubled in size.
    - Punch down the dough and divide it into 4 equal portions. Shape each portion into a ball and let them rest for 10 minutes.
    - Roll each dough ball into an oval shape, then fold the sides into the center and roll it up tightly. Place them seam side down into a greased loaf pan.
    - Cover the loaf pan and let the dough rise again until it reaches the rim of the pan.
    - Preheat the oven to 180°C, so it is ready when the loaf is done rising.
    - Bake the bread for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown on top.
    - Remove from the oven and let it cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
