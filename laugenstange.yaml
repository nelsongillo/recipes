instructions:
  - Mix the flour and salt in a large bowl.
  - Warm the water and milk to about 37°C, melt the butter and add to the liquids. Dissolve a bit of sugar and let cool to lukewarm, then dissolve the fresh yeast in the mixture. Let rest for 10-15 minutes.
  - Add the liquid mixture to the dry ingredients and kneed for about 10 minutes until a smooth and elastic dough forms, passing the windowpane test.
  - Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover and let it rise in a warm place until doubled in size.
  - Punch down the dough and divide it into 24 equal portions. Roll each portion into a rectangular shape and then roll it up tightly from the short side to form a stick shape.
  - Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add the baking soda.
  - Preheat the oven to 160°C and line baking sheets with parchment paper.
  - Carefully lower a few dough sticks at a time into the boiling baking soda water. Boil for about 30 seconds on each side, then remove with a slotted spoon and place them on the prepared baking sheets.
  - Cut a few slashes on top of each stick with a sharp knife and sprinkle with coarse salt.
  - Bake for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown.
